Nuxt provides a number of composables and built-in libraries that make it easier, and faster, to load third-party resources in your application.

- `useScript`: Load any third-party script with server-side rendering support and a proxied API.
- `useStyle`: Load any third-party stylesheet using various asset strategies.
- Third-Party Wrappers: Wrapper components and composables that make it easier to include different popular third parties efficiently.

## How Third-Parties Can Impact User Experience

Third parties are external resources included, but not directly controlled, by a site owner to add new functionality to a website. Popular examples of third parties include analytics, video embeds, maps, and social media integrations. Typically, third-party providers offer code snippets that can be added to the `head` or `body` section of the document.

Adding a single third-party resource to your Nuxt application might not have any noticeable impact on performance, but it can quickly begin to affect user experience if you’re not careful. Many third parties, especially scripts, can take a relatively long time to download and execute, which can delay user interactivity and block page rendering.

Data from the Chrome User Experience Report shows that Nuxt sites that load more third-party resources have lower [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/articles/inp) (INP) and [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) (LCP) pass rates.

While the chart's correlation does not automatically indicate causation, lab experiments and data from the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties) provide further evidence that third-party resources significantly affect page performance.

## Optimizing Third Party Performance

In general, it can be difficult to determine the most optimal way to load different third-party resources. Nuxt provides a number of utilities that include various approaches to improve both the developer and user experience of loading third parties.

### useScript

The `useScript` composable enables you to load third-party scripts with SSR support and a proxied API. It works out of the box, requiring just an ID and a URL that points to the script resource.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useScript({
  id: 'some_id',
  src: 'https://www.example.com/script.js'
})
</script>
```

Optional triggers and asset strategies can be used to allow for more fine-grained control over how, and when, the script should be loaded.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useScript({
  id: 'some_id',
  src: 'https://www.example.com/script.js',
  trigger: new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => { resolve() }, 1000)
  })
})
</script>
```

> For more details about triggers, asset strategies and other supported options, please refer to [link].

### useStyles

The `useStyles` composable enables you to load third-party stylesheets consistently.

```vue
<script setup>
useStyles(['https://www.example.com/styles.css'])
</script>
```

You can use optional asset strategies to inline styles directly in the `head` section of your `document`.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useStyles(
  ['https://www.example.com/styles.css'],
  { assetStrategy: 'inline' }
)
</script>
```

### Third Party Wrappers

A collection of utilities that are already configured to load and initialize popular third parties in the most performant way. These include:

- Composables to fetch scripts such as `useGoogleAnalytics` and `useGoogleTagManager`
- Components to load embeds such as `<GoogleMaps>` and `<YoutubeEmbed>`

#### Google Analytics

The `useGoogleAnalytics` composable allows you to integrate Google Analytics in your Nuxt application.

```vue
<script setup>
  useGoogleAnalytics({
   id: 'GA-123456789-1'
  })
</script>
```

Read more in [docs > api > composables > use-gogle-analytics](../3.api/2.composables/use-google-analytics.md)

#### Google Tag Manager

The `useGoogleTagManager` composable makes it easier to include Google Tag Manager to your Nuxt application.

```vue
<script setup>
  useGoogleTagManager({
   id: 'GTM-ABCD12'
  })
<script>
```

Read more in [docs > api > composables > use-gogle-tag-manager](../3.api/2.composables/use-google-tag-manager.md)

#### Google Maps

The `<GoogleMaps>` component initializes and displays a Google Map to your page using the Maps JavaScript API.

```vue
​​<template>
  <div>
    <GoogleMaps
      api-key="API_KEY"
      q="Space+Needle,Seattle+WA"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

Read more in [docs > api > components > google-maps](../3.api/1.components/12.google-maps.md).

#### YouTube Embed

The `<YoutubeEmbed>` component uses `lite-youtube-embed` under the hood to load and display a YouTube embed on your page faster.

```vue
​​<template>
  <div>
    <YoutubeEmbed
      video-id="d_IFKP1Ofq0"
      play-label="Play Video"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```
